### VIC-20 Tape Reader

This is a program for data migration from magnetic tapes produced by the VIC-20 Home Computer (by Commodore in the 1980s) to a PC using a soundcard. There existed then no direct way to do this. Although there were solutions for disk drives, I could not afford one, so I wrote this to get my precious old VIC-20 programs onto the PC to be able to run them in a VIC-20 emulator.

Written by me in 1997, I never personally uploaded this to the community, but sent it to a friend in New Zealand who published it on a bulletin board. The license was a simple freeware type one liner similar to the MIT License, under which I am placing it now.

I was told many years later that a number of other people managed to use this successfully to migrate their VIC-20 data tapes onto the PC, in addition to myself. Although this no longer serves any useful purpose, it might be interesting to some since it's written completely in x86-Assembler, so I'm uploading it here for curiosity. Yes that's 25 years too late, but better late than never :-)

I left it unchanged, the Readme with usage instructions is the file vtr.txt.
