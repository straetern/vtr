### VIC-20 Tape Reader

This is a program for data migration from magnetic tapes written by the VIC-20 Home Computer by Commodore to a PC using a soundcard.
It was written by me in 1997. I personally uploaded this to the community, but sent it to a friend in New Zealand who published it on a bulletin board.
I was told a number of other people used this successfully to migrate their VIC-20 data tapes onto the PC, in addition to myself.
Although this no longer serves any purpose, it might be interesting to some since it's written completely in x86-Assembler, so I'm uploading it here for curiosity, 25 years too late :-)
I left it unchanged, the Readme with usage instructions is the file vtr.txt.
