### VIC-20 Tape Reader

This is a program in x86-Assembler written by me in 1997 for data migration from magnetic tapes produced by the VIC-20 Home Computer (by Commodore in the 1980s) to a PC using a soundcard.

By the late 90s I had long since stopped using the VIC-20 (my first computer) and switched to the PC, but I still wanted to be able to run my first self-written programs and some old games on the PC using an emulator. I could not then find a satisfactory solution to do this and although it could be done with disk drives, I could not afford one at the time, so I wrote this.

I never personally uploaded this to the community, but sent it to an interested person in New Zealand who published it on a bulletin board. The license was a simple freeware type one liner similar to the MIT License, under which I am placing it now.

I was told many years later that a number of other people managed to use this successfully to migrate their VIC-20 data tapes onto the PC, in addition to myself. Although this no longer serves any useful purpose, it might be interesting to some since it's written completely in x86-Assembler, so I'm uploading it here for curiosity. Yes that's 25 years too late, but better late than never :-)

I left it unchanged, the Readme with usage instructions is the file vtr.txt.
